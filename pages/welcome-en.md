# Welcome to DanNet
DanNet is a WordNet for the Danish language created as a collaboration between [DSL][DSL] and [CST][CST]. This new edition of DanNet was first published in 2023.

A [WordNet][WordNet] is a lexico-semantic network graph that shows how senses of a language relate to others through named relations. One can also think of a WordNet as a kind of machine-readable thesaurus.

## Download datasets
You can traverse DanNet directly on wordnet.dk, but you may also download our data as an [RDF dataset][DanNet RDF] or in a slightly more limited [CSV edition][DanNet CSV]. These datasets can be used for natural language processing.

DanNet is also integrated with [COR][COR] and [DDS][DDS]. These alternative RDF datasets can also be downloaded on this page ([COR integration][COR-integration] og [DDS integration][DDS-integration]).

You may also download [DanNet+COR+DDS][DanNet+COR+DDS] as a combined dataset or download a [complete copy][complete] of all of the data that can be found on this website, including much additional, logically inferred data.
