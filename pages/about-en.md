# DanNet
DanNet is a WordNet for the Danish language created as a collaboration between [DSL][DSL] and [CST][CST]. This new edition of the language resource was first published in 2023 and has been supported by funding from the [Carlsberg Foundation][Carlsbergfondet].

## The structure of a WordNet
A [WordNet][WordNet] is a lexico-semantic network graph that shows how senses of a language relate to others through named relations. One can also think of a WordNet as a kind of machine-readable dictionary. To get a sense of what DanNet is, you can try searching for a lemma by clicking on the **looking glas** in the upper left corner.

Unlike a normal dictionary, the definitions of words aren't central; instead, relations to other words are the important part. For example, in DanNet you can see that a [Swiss willow][dværgpil] is a kind of [bush][busk], that a [gazebo][lysthus] is located in a [garden][have], that "[fiberdrys][fiberdrys]" is for [eating][spise], and that [cakes][kage] are typically produced by [baking][bage] and usually made from [flour][mel] and [sugar][sukker].

## Download our data
DanNet is based on the [Ontolex][Ontolex] standard with [additions][GWA RDF] from the [Global WordNet Association][GWA]. You can explore DanNet directly on wordnet.dk, but you may also download our data as an [RDF data set][DanNet RDF] or in a slightly more limited [CSV edition][DanNet CSV]. All our data sets are published under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

DanNet is integrated with [COR][COR] and [DDS][DDS] too. These alternative RDF data sets can also be downloaded on this page ([COR integration][COR-integration] og [DDS integration][DDS-integration]).

You may also download [DanNet+COR+DDS][DanNet+COR+DDS] as a combined data set or download a [complete copy][complete] of all the data that can be found on wordnet.dk/dannet, including logically inferred data and associated RDF schemas.
